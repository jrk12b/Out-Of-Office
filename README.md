Out of Office is a powerful tool to manage and plan your time off. The app allows you to track your available PTO days, see how many are remaining, and view a calendar of your planned PTO days. You can also set non-PTO days, add notes, and use the built-in habit tracker tab to create and track daily habits with visualizations over time. Whether youâ€™re planning vacations or building better routines, Out of Office helps you stay organized and in control.
